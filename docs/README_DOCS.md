# 📚 DreamOps Documentation Site

This directory contains the static website for DreamOps / Dream Container.

🌐 **Visit it at:** https://ahelme.github.io/dream-container/

## ⚠️ Important Note

**This is NOT part of your application** - it's just our docs & marketing site!

- If you're looking for **your** frontend code, go to `/frontend`
- If you're looking for **your** backend code, go to `/backend`
- If you're looking for **examples**, check out `/examples`

## 🚀 How This Works

This directory is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages whenever you push to the main branch. GitHub Pages serves these static files directly - no build process needed (staying true to our anti-bureaucracy philosophy!).

## 🛠️ Making Changes

1. Edit any HTML/CSS/JS files in this directory
2. Test locally by opening the HTML files in your browser
3. Commit and push to main branch
4. GitHub Pages automatically updates (usually within minutes)

## 💭 Philosophy

Even our documentation site follows the Dream Container philosophy:
- ✅ No build process
- ✅ No framework
- ✅ Just HTML, CSS, and minimal JS
- ✅ Fast, simple, maintainable

## 🎨 Keeping it Separate

Remember: This docs site is about **Dream Container itself**, not your application. Keep your actual application code in the `/frontend` and `/backend` directories!
